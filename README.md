# Adaptive Executor

A lightweight Java task execution framework with priority-based scheduling, dynamic worker scaling, and runtime metrics collection.

The executor automatically adjusts its worker count at runtime based on queue depth, CPU load, and throughput feedback — without requiring manual pool size tuning.

---

## Features

- **Priority scheduling** — `HIGH` tasks are always processed before `LOW` tasks
- **Dynamic worker scaling** — worker count adjusts automatically between configurable limits
- **PID-based scaling** — smooth, adaptive control via a PID controller
- **Threshold-based scaling** — simple queue-depth scaling for predictable workloads
- **CPU-aware scaling** — moderates scale-up under CPU saturation instead of blocking it
- **Gradual scale-down** — removes workers incrementally to avoid sudden capacity drops
- **Lock-free metrics** — all counters use `AtomicLong` / `AtomicInteger`
- **Queue wait tracking** — records how long tasks waited before execution
- **Pluggable strategies** — implement `ScalingStrategy` to use any custom algorithm

Build and install locally:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Quick Start

```java
AdaptiveExecutor executor = new AdaptiveExecutor(
        2,                          // minWorkers
        8,                          // maxWorkers
        new PidScalingStrategy(
                0.5,                // Kp
                0.01,               // Ki
                0.1));              // Kd

executor.submit(new TrackedTask(
        new AdaptiveTask() {

            @Override
            public TaskPriority priority() {
                return TaskPriority.HIGH;
            }

            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Running task");
            }
        },
        new TaskContext()));

// wait for completion
while (executor.metrics().completedTasks() < expectedCount) {
    Thread.sleep(10);
}

executor.shutdown();
```

---

## Creating Tasks

Extend `AdaptiveTask` and implement `priority()` and `run()`:

```java
AdaptiveTask task = new AdaptiveTask() {

    @Override
    public TaskPriority priority() {
        return TaskPriority.HIGH;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // task logic here
    }
};
```

Wrap it in a `TrackedTask` before submitting:

```java
executor.submit(new TrackedTask(task, new TaskContext()));
```

---

## Task Priorities

| Priority            | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TaskPriority.HIGH` | Processed before any `LOW` task — use for latency-sensitive work       |
| `TaskPriority.LOW`  | Processed after all `HIGH` tasks are drained — use for background work |

---

## Scaling Strategies

### PidScalingStrategy

Uses a PID controller to compute desired worker count from queue depth. Suitable for workloads with variable or bursty demand.

```java
new PidScalingStrategy(
        0.5,   // Kp — reacts to current queue size
        0.01,  // Ki — reacts to accumulated backlog
        0.1)   // Kd — reacts to rate of queue change
```

Includes **anti-windup** to prevent integral overshoot beyond `maxWorkers`.

Under CPU saturation (load > 85%), scale-up advances at half the normal rate — preserving throughput under noisy neighbour conditions without blocking scaling entirely.

### ThresholdScalingStrategy

Simple rule: `desired = max(minWorkers, queueSize / 5 + 1)`. Suitable for predictable, low-variance workloads.

```java
new ThresholdScalingStrategy()
```

Also moderates scale-up under CPU saturation.

### Custom Strategy

Implement `ScalingStrategy` to use any custom algorithm:

```java
public class MyStrategy implements ScalingStrategy {

    @Override
    public int desiredWorkers(ScalingContext ctx) {
        return Math.min(ctx.queueSize(), ctx.maxWorkers());
    }
}
```

---

## ScalingContext

Passed to the scaling strategy on every evaluation cycle:

| Field                         | Type     | Description                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `queueSize`                   | `int`    | Tasks waiting in the queue                          |
| `currentWorkers`              | `int`    | Total active worker threads                         |
| `activeWorkers`               | `int`    | Workers currently executing a task                  |
| `minWorkers`                  | `int`    | Worker count floor                                  |
| `maxWorkers`                  | `int`    | Worker count ceiling                                |
| `cpuLoad`                     | `double` | JVM process CPU load `[0.0, 1.0]`                   |
| `throughputPerWorker`         | `double` | Completed tasks per active worker in the last cycle |
| `previousThroughputPerWorker` | `double` | Same metric from the previous cycle                 |
| `avgExecutionTimeMillis`      | `double` | Rolling average task execution time                 |

---

## Scaling Behaviour

The `ScalingManager` evaluates every **200ms** with a **1s cooldown** between actions.

**Scale-up:** triggered when `desired > current`. Under CPU saturation, only half the gap is covered per cycle.

**Scale-down:** triggered when `desired < current`, subject to two guards:

1. Suppressed if `queueSize + activeWorkers >= currentWorkers` — all workers have pending work
2. Maximum **2 workers removed per cycle** — prevents sudden capacity collapse between bursts

---

Access runtime metrics at any time:

```java
ExecutorMetrics m = executor.metrics();
